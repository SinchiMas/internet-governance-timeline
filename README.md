in an effort to better focus advocacy efforts and understand where main discussions about global
Internet governance are taking place over the next year. 

The authors were specifically aiming to:

1. identify forums where Internet governance is being discussed/decided over the next year; 
2. identify avenues for participation for civil society to influence those processes. 

The authors have taken two particular processes and their relevant outcomes as the end
points -- the *ITU Plenipotentiary 2014* and the *WSIS+10 review event in 2015*
-- and weaved other forums around them.
